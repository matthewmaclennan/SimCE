1. Run the au3 script.
2. Make sure the au3 script only saves a segment of the SimCE3 mesh (in order to reduce file size)
3. Import the script into R and execute the R scripts (can also be called by autoit):
      a. read in the asc file with SimCE3meshMatrix.R
      b. convert matrix into list with SimCE3meshMat2List.R
      c. create matrices of a single concentration profile using SimCE3meshMatRearr.R
      d. plot the matrices using image() or persp3d()
      e. use another plotter which can plot points with the potential for regression
4. Store results in relevant XML-based format for database
5. Calculate other properties from this data (K etc...)
6. Select real molecular candidates based on binding constants (check databases).
